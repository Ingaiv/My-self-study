# SQL
## Database management system (DBMS)

> Database management system
>> is software to create and manage databases, allowing users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.
>> The DBMS provides a centralized view of data that can be accessed by multiple users from multiple locations in a controlled manner.

### Relational databases
>> A relational database typically stores information in tables containing specific pieces and types of data. This form of data storage is often called structured data.For example, a shop could store details of their customersâ€™ names and addresses in one table and details of their orders in another. 

### Non-relational databases
>> Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form. Instead, non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents. A document can be highly detailed while containing a range of different types of information in different formats. 

### UNION Operator
>> The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

### SQL Joins
>> A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
