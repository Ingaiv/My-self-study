### Software testing ###
is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification.
Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. 


Test techniques include, but not necessarily limited to:

* analyzing the product requirements for completeness and correctness in various contexts like industry perspective, business perspective, feasibility and viability of implementation, usability, performance, security, infrastructure considerations, etc.
* reviewing the product architecture and the overall design of the product
* working with product developers on improvement in coding techniques, design patterns, tests that can be written as part of code based on various techniques like boundary conditions, etc.
* executing a program or application with the intent of examining behavior
* reviewing the deployment infrastructure and associated scripts and automation
* take part in production activities by using monitoring and observability techniques

#### Verification #### 
is the process of checking that a software achieves its goal without any bugs. It is the process to ensure whether the product that is developed is right or not. It verifies whether the developed product fulfills the requirements that we have. Verification is static testing. 

Verification means 
**Are we building the product right?**

#### Validation #### 
is the process of checking whether the software product is up to the mark or in other words product has high level requirements. It is the process of checking the validation of product i.e. it checks what we are developing is the right product. it is validation of actual and expected product. Validation is the dynamic testing. 

Validation means 
**Are we building the right product?**

There are generally four recognized levels of testing: 
* unit/component testing, 
* integration testing, 
* system testing, 
* acceptance testing.
